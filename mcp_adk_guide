## Page 1: Introduction to Agentic AI and MCP

### What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI is the next evolution of artificial intelligence where models aren't just passive tools answering questions—they're active problem-solvers. They can plan tasks, interact with tools (like calendars, databases, or APIs), and make decisions step-by-step. Think of them like AI coworkers rather than simple chatbots.

### Why This Guide?
Today’s AI often operates in silos. Want your chatbot to check inventory or pull customer data? You need custom integrations every time. This is slow, inefficient, and hard to scale. That’s where **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** comes in.

### What is MCP?
MCP is a universal language created by Anthropic in 2024 to help AI models talk to external systems—like APIs, databases, tools—easily and securely. It replaces the need for custom connectors with a single standard, like using one remote control for all your devices.

## Page 2: Understanding MCP - The Building Blocks

### Why Was MCP Needed?
Before MCP:
- Each AI model needed its own custom connection to each tool
- Developers faced the MxN problem (N tools x M models = chaos)
- AI responses lacked real-time awareness

With MCP:
- One AI can talk to any tool that supports MCP
- Tools are reusable and discoverable
- AI agents become smarter and more flexible

### How Does MCP Work?
- **Standard Language:** JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Communication Channels:** HTTP or Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Plug-and-play Tools:** Tools are exposed via MCP Servers

### Core MCP Components
- **MCP Server:** The host for tools (e.g., memory, fetch, time)
- **SDKs:** Provided in Python and TypeScript
- **Smithery.ai:** Public registry where tools are published and discovered

### Where to Explore MCP Servers?
Visit [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) to browse available MCP servers. Some examples include:
- **Fetch:** Pulls live web content for LLMs
- **Filesystem:** Access files with permissions
- **Memory:** Persistent context store using knowledge graphs
- **Time:** Handles date and timezone operations
- **Toolbox MCP:** Dynamically routes to any tool on Smithery

## Page 3: Real Advantages of Using MCP

### 1. Solves the Interconnectivity Problem
Traditionally: Connect AI to 10 tools = 10 integrations  
With MCP: Just 1 integration for the AI and 1 for each tool

### 2. Enables Tool Discovery in Real Time
Agents can ask, “What tools are available?” and pick the best one at runtime.

### 3. Boosts Collaboration Between Agents
Agents can share a common context, call each other, and divide tasks like a team.

### 4. Improves AI Accuracy
With access to real data and tools, hallucinations (AI making up answers) decrease.

### 5. Open and Extensible
Because it’s open-source and technology-agnostic, any developer can build MCP tools or servers that work with any model.

## Page 4: MCP Tool Types Explained

### Tool Types
1. **Code Interpreter**: Run calculations, generate plots, or clean data  
2. **OpenAPI Tools**: Call external APIs like Stripe, GitHub, Weather API  
3. **Data Store Tools**: Query structured/unstructured data (like PDFs, FAQs)  
4. **Connector Tools**: Integrate with Google Connectors (Salesforce, BigQuery)  
5. **Function Tools**: Perform client-side tasks (used in apps or UIs)

### Use Case Example
Imagine a customer support agent:
- Uses Data Store to understand policy documents
- Uses OpenAPI to file a support ticket
- Uses Connector Tool to update Salesforce

All this happens seamlessly in one conversation.

## Page 5: Integrating MCP with Google ADK

### What is ADK?
Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a framework for building intelligent agents with decision-making workflows. It supports:
- Sequential, parallel, or looped tasks
- Calling tools like search, code execution
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Deployment across environments (local, Docker, Vertex AI)

### How MCP Enhances ADK
- **Standardized Access:** No need to hardcode every tool  
- **Tool Discovery:** ADK agents can pull tools from an MCP Server dynamically  
- **Real-Time Reasoning:** Agents use ReAct pattern (Reason → Action → Observe)  
- **Examples:** An ADK agent accessing an MCP server to pull real-time product info from an eCommerce API

### How to Integrate an MCP Server into ADK
1. **Create your MCP Server** using `FastMCP` or TypeScript SDK  
2. **Expose Tools** using decorators (e.g., `@mcp.tool` in Python)  
3. **Run with SSE or HTTP** and deploy to local or cloud  
4. **Connect in ADK Code**:
   ```python
   from adk.mcp import MCPToolset, SseServerParams
   toolset = await MCPToolset.from_server(SseServerParams(uri="http://localhost:8001/sse"))
   tools = await toolset.get_tools_async()
   ```
5. **Use with LLM Agent** in your ADK agent logic

## Page 6: Best Practices, Security, and Future Outlook

### Best Practices
- Write clear examples in Playbooks (better than overly strict instructions)  
- Reference tools properly (${TOOL: tool_name})  
- Use concise outputs to reduce latency  
- Cache repetitive responses

### Security Essentials
- Use Service Accounts, Secret Manager for API keys  
- Enable VPC and TLS for secure tool access  
- Log everything for observability

### The Future of MCP & ADK
- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** AI agents will collaborate like teams  
- **Multimodal Tools:** Tools for video, images, and audio coming soon  
- **Unified Assistants:** Imagine a single AI helping you across apps, devices, and services

### Final Thought
MCP and ADK together create a new paradigm: where AI doesn’t just answer—it acts. This guide is your starting point to explore that future.
